                <p>
                  This blog describes the experiences I had and and learning goals achieved during my time as 
                  a School of Computer Science Research Co-op. After reading you will know exactly how I grew as a
                  developer and these skills will benefit my future career as a Software Engineer.

                <h3>Job Decription</h3>
                <p>
                  My job was to research and document current applications made for providing information that would inform users 
                  on how to best sort waste items for disposal based on region (starting with the City of Guelph). After this I 
                  had to gauge what worked best and develop documentation and designs for a new 
                  application with the goal that people would be more informed of waste sorting when using the application.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3 align="center">Goals</h3>
            <div class="container">
              <h4>Goal 1: Work with stakeholders to develop a set of meaningful requirements to guide the design of the system</h4>
              <p>
                Something that is taught to us in our Software Design courses is the Software development life cycle. 
                This cycle describes the various steps involved for the development and maintenance of software products. 
                The first major task for me was to get in contact with the stakeholders (Maria and her team) to gather a list
                of requirements for the application that they needed. So after coordinating closely with Maria and the team, I 
                developed a set of requirements that outline the major short-term and long-term high-level goals of the proposed 
                application and system. Some examples of these were: making the system malleable enough to be implemented in other 
                regions with ease, available on a variety of platforms, and more. Following the software design principles shown in 
                the classroom, these requirements were categorized by priority and made so that they were reasonable and testable. 
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
              <h4>Goal #2: Design through iteration using various different prototyping methods (wireframing, UML diagrams, etc.)</h4>
              <p>
                Once the initial set of requirements and user stories were made, I moved on to writing specifications for 
                the design of the application. Paper prototyping is a useful tool that is uses in the user interface design aspect 
                of software development, and helps smoothen out the flow of the application when users are experience the app firsthand. 
                Since this position was remote we had to resort to using online prototyping/wireframing tools for everyone to partake in prototyping sessions. 
                I conducted two separate prototyping sessions, one with Dan, and the other with Maria and her team. This was to get separate opinions, one from a
                 developer standpoint and one from the Product Owner. Designing the database was a little difficult since we had very little initial data to work with,
                  so a lot of assumptions had to be made in regards to the minimum data we would need to make this app work better than current versions of it.  
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
              <h4>Goal #3: Documentation to support this project beyond the semester</h4>
              <p>
                After developing the plans for all the initial aspects of the application, I started work on a document that would 
                thoroughly describe the information gathered in requirements gathering process, and assist any future maintainers and developers
                 of the project by presenting all the information in a single document. 

              </p>
            </div>
            <h3 align="center">Conclusion</h3>
            <div class="container">
              <p>
                So far in my program, my co-op experience has been the most important contribution to the development of myself as a software engineer. 
                It has given me a first hand look at what it means to write useful software spec and how I can become more efficient as a developer, and
                 realize the impact of my work while also equipping me with the skills needed to be successful in this career path. Many of the goals I set when
                  beginning my work terms were met and I know with all the new things learnt in this position I will reach even further heights during the rest of my career.

            <h3 align="center">Acknowledgements</h3>
            <div class="container">
              <p>
                I wanted to give a great big thank you to Dan Gillis and Maria Corradini, they were both extremely supportive and helpful during my time in this position, 
                and gave me a lot of room to work and conduct the research activities.
